# Bacteria-Diversity

## Overview
The information displayed here categorizes the bacteria that live in different peoples bellybuttons.  Microbiology researcher Roza believes there is a species of bacteria in the bellybutton that produces compounds that will produce the perfect taste for imitation beef.  To test this hypothesis, Roza swabbed the bellybuttons of participants and cultured them to quantify which species inhabit different participants and in what abundance these species were found.  If a species that produces a meaty flavor is later discovered, this dashboard will allow participants in the study to look up their participant ID to discover what species colonize their bellybuttons and whether their bacteria could be sold.
